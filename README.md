AI-powered Image Intelligence for the Digital Age 
Overview
Images can be manipulated, misused, or taken out of context — spreading misinformation and deepfakes.

That’s where PicIntel comes in:
An AI-driven OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) platform that verifies image authenticity, traces its origin, and uncovers hidden metadata — all in one click.

🔍 Features
Authenticity Check: Detects manipulations using deepfake & ELA analysis.
Metadata Intelligence: Extracts EXIF data, GPS info, timestamps, and OCR text.
Reverse Image Search: Finds similar images across the web.
Automated Reporting: Generates a PDF report with confidence scores.
